# Rheo-Model

Rheology Model Calculation - LAOS & Startup

This is a MATLAB code for the calculation of Rheology model. The first example is using a Rolie-Poly model [1].

# StartUp Shear

## Function used in ODE solver

The matrix form is believed to speed up the calculation. 

## For Loop to explore the frequency range of interest

Potential improvement in the Parallel Computing.

# LAOS

## Function used in ODE solver

Shear rate is now a parameter that could be changed in LAOS.

# MATLAB runtime

To use MATLAB runtime, download the version 9.3 (R2017b) of the MATLAB Runtime from the website (https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) and install it before running the .exe file.
